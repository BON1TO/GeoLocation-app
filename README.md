This Geolocation App allows users to save and manage locations efficiently. Built using React, it integrates the OpenRouteService (ORS) API to calculate distances between saved locations. 
Users can add, view, and organize places seamlessly, making it useful for travel planning and navigation-based tasks. 
The app features a clean UI with smooth interactions and real-time distance calculations. 
Optimized for performance, it ensures quick data retrieval and efficient API usage. 
Future improvements may include map visualizations and advanced filtering.
This project highlights effective API integration and React development, offering a practical solution for location tracking and management.
